              <p>Recycl.AI is trained to recongise three main classes; Deposit recycling, Regualar recycling, and Flexible plastic. These classes contain most of the common items that are often not disposed off properly.</p>

              <p>In Canada, only 9% of plastic waste is actually recycled, while the rest go into landfills and the environment. In the United States, only 5% is actually recycled. Together we can change this and work to impact the environment in a positive way.</p>

              <h1>Flexible Plastics</h1>
              <p>Flexible plastic is a type of plastic that can be easily bent or folded without breaking. This category includes materials like plastic bags, shrink wrap, candy wrappers and flexible packaging </p>

                  <p> When flexible plastic is recycled, it undergoes a process where it is collected, sorted, cleaned, and melted into pellets. The pellets which can then be used to manufacture a variety of items, such as new bags, containers, or even synthetic clothes. In British Columbia flexible plastics can recycled at recycle depos throughout the province. <a class= "normal-link" href='https://recyclebc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Flexible-Plastics_Material-List_January-2023.pdf'>Click here for a list of accepted flexible plastics</a> </p>
