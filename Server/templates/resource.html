                  <p>At the recycle depo, the returned containers are collected, sorted, cleaned, and processed to separate the materials for recycling. For example, aluminum cans may be melted down and used to make new cans, while plastic bottles may be shredded and transformed into new plastic products. The recovered materials are then sold to manufacturers who use them to make a wide range of goods. Deposit recycling encourages the proper disposal of beverage containers, reduces litter, and promotes resource conservation by ensuring that valuable materials are recycled and reused. <a class= "normal-link" href='https://www.return-it.ca/beverage/products/'> Click here for a list of redemable items at BC Return It locations</a> </p>

                  <p>When regular plastic is recycled, it undergoes a series of steps to transform it into new products. First, the plastic is collected and sorted based on its type and grade. Then, it is cleaned and shredded into small pieces or pellets, which are then melted down and formed into new items through processes like injection molding or extrusion. Recycled plastic can be used to manufacture a variety of products, including furniture, automotive parts, and construction materials. Recycling regular plastic helps greatly reduces the amount of trash going to landfills.<a class= "normal-link" href='https://recyclebc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Recycle-BC-Material-List-2023-English.pdf'> Click here for a list of accepted plastics</a>  </p>
